# DreamBoard Backend Code

This directory contains the backend code to run the AI text/image/video generation services of DreamBoard. The code is to be deployed on GCP as a Cloud Run Service and accessed as an API. The backend is FastAPI-based and can run individually as an API server without the frontend.

# Structure

The general folder structure is as follows under backend/app:

- api: Contains backend API routing code.
  - endpoints: Endpoints for each type of AI generation (text, image, video).
- core: Contains configuration of the backend server.
- dreamboard: (optional) Folder used for local/development environments. Environment variable must be set to "DEV" to use this folder.
- models: Contains API request and response objects for text/image/video.
- prompts: Prompts used to for text/image/video generation.
- services: Actual code that runs the generation.
- tests: Directory for test cases.

## Requirements

- A Google Cloud Platform project with access to the following:
  - Veo3
  - Imagen4
  - Gemini
  - Cloud Storage FUSE
  - Cloud Storage Bucket - to store the image and video results
- A service account to invoke Cloud Run Service, start AI generation, and other associated compute access. Please see the deploy_backend.sh script for specific service account permissions
- Deployment individual to have permission to the following:
  - Build Cloud Run Service
  - Create Cloud Storage Buckets
  - Enable APIs
  - Create service account and apply IAM permissions (if creating at deployment time)

# Installation

DreamBoard can be deployed locally on a laptop for personal use or on Google Cloud as Cloud Run Service. 

### Deploy on Google Cloud

Run `deploy_backend.sh` in the backend folder. 

Make note of the following items for use in deploying the frontend:
- GCP Project Id
- Cloud Storage Bucket Name
- Location
- Cloud Run Service Name Deployed

If you wish to change the name of items such as the service account name, service name, or bucket name you may modify the `deploy_backend.sh`. Follow the prompts to create the service. 


### Deploy Locally

Locally, this code can run with the following commands in a Linux-based CLI (change directory to backend directory first):

- `cd /backend/app`
- `uv add -r requirements.txt`
- `gcloud auth application-default login`

Create a `.env` folder in `/backend/app` (next to `main.py`) with the following fields:

```
  - PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
  - LOCATION=<YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION>
  - GCS_BUCKET=<YOUR_GCS_BUCKET>
  - ENV=dev
  - FIRESTORE_DB=dreamboard-db
  - USE_AUTH_MIDDLEWARE=true
```

- `uv run fastapi dev app/main.py`
