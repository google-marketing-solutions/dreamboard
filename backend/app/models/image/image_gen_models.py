  Represents a single image, typically as a response from an Imagen API

      gcs_uri: The Google Cloud Storage (GCS) URI where the image is stored.
      mime_type: The MIME type of the image (e.g., 'image/jpeg', 'image/png').
      signed_uri: A pre-signed URL for temporary public access to the GCS URI.
      gcs_fuse_path: The FUSE path if the GCS bucket is mounted locally.

                      "mask"). Uses `IMAGE_REFERENCE_TYPES` values.
      reference_subtype: A more specific classification within the type
                         (e.g., "Person", "Animal" for 'subject' type).
      description: A text description providing more context for the reference
                   (e.g., for 'style' or 'subject' references).
      mask_mode: For 'mask' references, specifies how the mask should be
                 interpreted (e.g., "apply", "ignore").
      mask_dilation: For 'mask' references, an optional value to expand or
                     contract the mask area.
      segmentation_classes: For 'mask' references, a list of integer IDs
                            representing object classes to be masked.
